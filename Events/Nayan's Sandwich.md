Your first quest is to make a sandwich for your hungry brother before he tries to beat you in Touhou.

"Nayan's Special" is a complex recipe made of: sausage(two layers for extra happiness), cheddar cheese, bell pepper, tomato, avocado, corn (don't forget!), hot sauce, egg, olives, butter, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard. Thankfully, Karam is a master chef.

You can:
- Go in his room without anything, starving him. By his earlier words, this should lower his chances of beating you (not that he had any to begin with \`w´) yet doesn't seem to change his abilities.
- Tease him by going in his room with the ingredients.
- Tease his nostrils by eating the sandwich before entering.
- Bring him his sandwich for a fair fight.
- Be the best brother ever and bring him water too.

After this event, you get to keep the sandwich, though it does nothing.
