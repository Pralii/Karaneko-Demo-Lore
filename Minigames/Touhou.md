- Features Reira, a reference to Reimu Hakurei. Karam's "Best " 
- 「No way you can escape. :3」 *forces you into the game*
- Is a direct reference to Touhou 06's first stage, with the main boss being Cirno
- Beating the boss doesn't achieve anything, the game loops.
- Due to a player skill underestimation the devs didn't expect anyone to loop and there is a bug allowing minions to come assist the boss in the first phase, whereas they should come in during its third phase.
There are two outcomes:
- Beating your brother
- Giving him the time of his LIFE by losing at your most skilled game (not on purpose... right?), he still demands another fight in chess to confirm his "superiority" :3
Replaying changes nothing.
