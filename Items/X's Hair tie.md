A red hair tie findable on the floor of [[Karam's Room (IRL)]], Yurim likes to play with it.
Interacting with it brings up a memory about X giving it to you, though you never used it.

You can pick it up, though it doesn't appear in your inventory and doesn't seem to affect future dialog. [[To be confirmed.]]

X's Hair tie is mentioned in Caturday news: X seeing Karam with it on his wrist stunned her for a bit. It is akin to a token of their love.
