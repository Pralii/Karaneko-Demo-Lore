「One of your favorite items: Your beloved broom. Its presence fills you with peace. You are not sure how you'd do without it.」

- You can clean up Yurim's hair balls on the ground with it.
- Seeing your reflection on the mirror with it for the first time makes you look cool. Mr. Clean. (Karam cringes a bit)

Findable in [[Karam's Room (IRL)]] in the supply box.
