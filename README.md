# Karaneko-Demo-Lore
A repository meant to centralize the notes taken by fans for the lore delivered in Karaneko Demo in order to create a Lore video with fan-made theories about the universe of this upcoming game.  

## What is KARANEKO? 
KARANEKO is a turn-based game that combines JRPG elements with Visual Novel storytelling featuring a bullet hell system inspired by games like UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE planning to launch in... 2027 (don't trust this).

Playing as Karam, the player awakens in a new world and sets out on a journey to find his brother.
As you travel, you’ll meet others whose paths intertwine with yours, build meaningful connections, and slowly unravel the secrets buried within this mysterious world.

You’ll encounter thrilling, ever-changing bullet hell battles where you can tackle each confrontation your own way, adjusting the intensity and challenge to match your personal playstyle.

Choices you make in conversations and battles can have short or long-term effects that alter your gaming experience.

See more on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3102220/KARANEKO/) where the Demo is available.

The game is actually on Kickstarter, go check it out!

# Is this official?
## Short answer: **No.** 
It's all directed by fans of the game, independantly from the devs. The lore and notes are taken from what we observe in-game and around it. We do chat with the dev team though!

This whole project is coordinated within the official Karaneko Discord Server. Feel free to join in through official links findable on Kickstarter or online!

# Is the content of this equivalent to a wiki?
Mmmmmaybe. Probably. But less descriptive, more oriented towards noticing neat details and lore/character discussion.

# What are you using?
We'll be using [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/) for gathering notes in an organized manner
**Discord** for coordination and chatting about the project

For video editing uh we're not there yet.

## Importing all the notes into Obsidian
This is destined for people who find GitHub complicated. 

### For your first time:
- Download the whole project (with the green `<> Code` button -> Download ZIP)
- Extract it into a folder wherever you want it to be
- Get the "Manage vaults" window in Obsidian (accessible in a submenu in the bottom left if not open by default)
- Open folder as vault the extracted folder

### For getting the latest version:
- Download what you want to get and replace the old note(s) in your folder.
