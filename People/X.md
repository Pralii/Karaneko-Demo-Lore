Transcript of discussion with Power:

1. They used to be a couple
    
2. ### Pralii~~
    
    Yeah I could see that
    
3. though Karam seemed a bit dense? Or X got kinda shy, I need to read again
    
4. I really wonder if picking the hair scrunchie(?) thing on the ground changes something somewhere in the demo
    
5. I didn't notice anything regarding X
    
6. ### Power
    
    Karam just ghosted the entire group, including X, after the incident. X aint shy, Karam is just being an ass
    
1. ### Pralii
    
    Oh so the Caturday about X's pov was after the incident ?
    
2. (I should read again, it is a lot of lore to consider and extract for one reading)
    
3. ### Pralii
    
    Oh well that yeah, I was referring to before the incident, there's that caturday news about X becoming all anxious about Karam and them not speaking that much anymore That changes a bit my vision of her character if that's after the incident (hm thinking about it, it probably is), and cool it's a bit more complex now in my head
    
4. Oh my. I'm thinking about why does Karam isolates himself that much, and I'm seeing some parallel with Yurim's psyche (when faced with abandonment, she isolates herself "more", by force) there's plenty to discuss about these psychologies and I'd love to, but later, you'll see my takes in the vid discussion anyway
    
5. ### Pralii~~
    
    -> It is not clearly stated or deductible that it's before or after the incident But we can think about it and assume that their relation changed greatly indirectly _because_ of the incident affecting them both personally on how they manage relations in this post-traumatic time. I doubt it was a direct degradation because of how the incident occured, rather more something like they both changed a lot and are going through things




- Is studious
X because she's his ex
