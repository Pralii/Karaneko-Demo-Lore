- adorable ball of brotherly cuteness
- Completed [[Touhou]] easy mode! Took him all night! ggs
- Challenges [[Karam]] to gaming duels often, though he seems to always lose. The singular exception being a pillow fight with Voli the pirate whale. He doesn't always finish his chess matches properly.
- Loves his brother.
- Is confident in his cooking skills, but not very proficient. Relying despite his best efforts on big bro Karam
- Has a very good sense of smell for his favorite [[Nayan's Sandwich|Sandwich]] 
- Nayan received a pet fish "Jack" from [[X]] at around the same time Karam received  [[Yurim]] at his [[Birthday]]. Jack died but he keeps the fishbowl of his legendary crew in his room for good memories.
- He can play Piano, and even wrote a (scrapped) song to his brother together with [WHO?], although he's a bit ashamed of that...
